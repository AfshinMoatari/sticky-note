# Sticky Note Application

Web Application made for saving your important notes :)

## Installing

1. Download the project!
2. Run you prefer development environment, [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for instance. I used [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com/) which runs on top of XAMPP
3. Open the phpMyAdmin and create a new database with the name of: `notes_app`
4. Import the tables from `database/notes_app.sql` into your newly created database
5. Install the Sass: `gem install sass`
6. Change the current directory to project folder : `cd ../[directory]`
7. Run the Sass compiler: `sass --watch scss:css`
8. Open the localhost server and then signup for a new user and start saving your Notes.

## Extra

You can ignore registration for new users and use the dummy user information in order to log into the application. This user's profile also contains some dummy data.

username: `admin`
email: `admin@domain.com`
password: `admin123`
